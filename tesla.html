      <h2>Information About Tesla</h2>
      <p>Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors), founded in 2003, is an American multinational corporation based in Palo
        Alto, California, that specializes in electric vehicles, lithium-ion battery energy storage and solar panel
        manufacturing (through the subsidiary company SolarCity). As of June 2018, Tesla sells the Tesla
        Model S, Model X, and Model 3 vehicles, Powerwall and Powerpack batteries, solar panels, solar roof tiles, and
        related products.
      </p>
      <p>The company was conceived and founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Current CEO Elon Musk
        said that he envisions Tesla as a technology company and independent automaker, aimed at eventually
        offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer. The company enjoys various forms
        of federal and state subsidy, which it was estimated in 2015 amounted to at least $30,000 for each vehicle
        sold, or cumulatively $4.9 billion. Tesla, Inc. was named for the electrical engineer and physicist
        Nikola Tesla by company co-founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning
